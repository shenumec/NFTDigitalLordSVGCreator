NFTDigitalLordSVGCreator

This project is created as part of NFT Vision Hack. 
This project is used to generate the Art work using custom generative alogrithm. 

## What it does
Traits.cs file defines the characteristic of a trait.
Constants.cs file contains the definition of current traits. Basically Gene's, constraints and the SVG's. To add more traits, this file needs to be modified.  
Program.cs currently iterates thru the all traits and creates the final art work by combining the SVG's in the traits as per the Gene's. 

## Inspiration
The final art work is inspired from Avatars by Lord Vishnu. 
Code inspiration from HashMasks and Avastars.

## How to use
Project is self containing. Open in compatible Visual Studio and Run. You will see ~200 cute little Digital Lords in local output folder.
